    <section id="about">
      I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user
      interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. My
      favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development, creating
      experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for
      performance and usability. Currently, I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer at
      Klaviyo, specializing in accessibility. I contribute to the creation and
      maintenance of UI components that power Klaviyo’s frontend, ensuring our
      platform meets web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver
      an inclusive user experience. In the past, I've had the opportunity to
      develop software across a variety of settings — from advertising agencies
      and large corporations to start-ups and small digital product studios.
      Additionally, I also released a comprehensive video course a few years
      ago, guiding learners through building a web app with the Spotify API. In
      my spare time, I’m usually climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and
      two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seedsKorok seeds.
